## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
DiagrammeR::DiagrammeR("
  graph TB
     subgraph preprocess
     A(get daily data)-->B(transform to weekly)
     B --> C(train-test split)
     end
     subgraph crossvalidate
     C -.-> I[pick n initial points of data]
     I -.-> J[split the rest to 20 o4 30 folds]
     J -.-> K[for each fold]
     K --> L[forecast four observations using smoothing <br> with pre-set parameters]
     L --> M[get MSE, MAE, and MAPE of forecast with <br> validation set in next fold]
     M --> N[merge fold to training set]
     N --> K
     end
     subgraph split
     C -.- D[on Oct 10, 2018] 
     D -.- E[on Jan 07, 2020] 
     E -.- F[on Apr 27, 2020]
     F -.- G[on Nov 01, 2020]
     end
     G -.-> C
  ")
```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
